# Tickets

Ticket folders are organized by execution state:

- `in-progress/`: active tickets currently being implemented or validated.
- `done/`: completed tickets with implementation and verification records.

Workflow rule:

1. Create each new ticket under `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/`.
2. Keep all planning/requirements/design/progress files in that ticket folder.
3. After completion, move the whole folder to `tickets/done/<ticket-name>/`.
